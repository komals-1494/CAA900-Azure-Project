### Collaboration in GitHub - Suggestions
Suggestion: @AtoosaNasiri-Seneca

Suggestion 1: It would be good to have more information regarding the due dates in the checkpoint instructions itself.
Suggestion 2: The instructions are good but there is too much text. It would be good to have some reference images.
Suggestion 3: It would be nice to have a sample submission template to have a better idea regarding the submission so that we know what needs to be done.
